# Grocery-Shopping

## Problem Statement:
Keeping track of household inventory and predicting when items are about to run out can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Manually monitoring inventory levels and remembering past consumption patterns can lead to frequent stock-outs, resulting in inconvenience and unnecessary trips to the store.

## Hypothesis:
- Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict when household grocery items will run out, based on historical consumption data and contextual factors.

## Choosing an Appropriate ML Algorithm:

### Regression:
Regression algorithms are suitable for predicting continuous numerical values like "days_last".

#### Linear Regression:
- A simple model for linear relationships.
- Suitable for scenarios where the relationship between input variables and output is linear.
