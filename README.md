# Grocery-Shopping using Supervised Learning

## Hypothesis:
- Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict when household grocery items will run out, based on historical consumption data and contextual factors.

## Choosing an Appropriate ML Algorithm:

### Regression:
Regression algorithms are suitable for predicting continuous numerical values like "days_last".

#### Linear Regression:
- A simple model for linear relationships.
- Suitable for scenarios where the relationship between input variables and output is linear.
